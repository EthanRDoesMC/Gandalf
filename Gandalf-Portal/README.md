# Notes
- You can test Gandalf using the *New Package* in my repo. (removed! get it from https://supermamon.github.io/Reposi3 in Cydia.)

- Installation will be finalized in Manager when Manager is a thing. Shell scripts are fine for us but not for the masses. 

- Will be in both the repo and Manager. 

- Porting to other versions. Gandalf Pangu 7 is a test. Was seeing if Gandalf had a point in time where it broke that I could get it to work. Nothing. Guess we'll never know why it worked for that time. 

- Uninstalls old things and poor Dillan's CydiaExtenderPlus upon installation.
