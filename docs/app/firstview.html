      <p>
        Gandalf is a tweak which protects you from installing
        "bad tweaks". Bad tweaks are tweaks which could screw up your
        Jailbreak. However gandalf can be removed by any other tweak which
        conflicts with Gandalf. So we must somehow prevent this from happening.
        So we ask you to do that. Please go to the maintenance section in this
        app and tap hold gandalf.

      <h2>How to get involved</h2>
      <p>
        If you find a "bad tweak" just get the bundle identifier from Cydia
        (you can find it near the bottom of a tweak description). After you have
        gotten this identifier go to our
        <a href="https://github.com/ethanrdoesmc/gandalf">repository on GitHub</a>.
        There please fork the repository (you can find the button on the top
        right in the desktop view).
