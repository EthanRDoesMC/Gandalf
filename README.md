# Gandalf for Cydia

### Broken tweaks shall not pass!

/docs is where the repo lives.

/Gandalf is where development of the actual tweak happens.

/Images is where logos are made.

/.git is a living testament to how bad version control can be. It's the reason the repo's so big. Best to have one clone and git pull.

Each folder has its own README.md. They'll guide you from there.

#### Important things

- Overall, Gandalf could use a facelift.
