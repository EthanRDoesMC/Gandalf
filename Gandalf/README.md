### DANGEROUS TWEAKS SHALL NOT PASS

Did you know? Control file fields can be entered in any order. This means the death of a bajillion folders! We can just print the contents of 2 files (and maybe one day, 1!) instead of 4! ...Those are new files that have to be tracked, aren't they... I'll get that when this refurbishment is done.

# How to install?
Install via my repo: https://ethanrdoesmc.github.io/gandalf/
Tap [this](cydia://url/https://cydia.saurik.com/api/share#?source=https://ethanrdoesmc.github.io/gandalf/) to open in Cydia.
There's also a little repo installer thing on my personal repo. https://ethanrdoesmc.github.io/repo

Add an incompatible package identifier to the conflicts.txt file in the folder of the Gandalf version. 

E.g. If you want to add a packet identifier to Gandalf for Yalu102, open the folder *102* and there add it to the file *conflicts.txt*.
After that make a pull request. 
> Packages have to be added **by starting a new line**
Be sure the conflicts are in alphabetical order. 

> If the release is behind, use `bash` to compile:
